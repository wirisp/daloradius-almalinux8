# About

![daloradius_logo][daloRADIUS_Logo]

[daloRADIUS](http://www.daloradius.com) is an advanced RADIUS web management application aimed at managing hotspots and
general-purpose ISP deployments. It features user management, graphical reporting, accounting,
a billing engine and integrates with GoogleMaps for geo-locating.

daloRADIUS is written in PHP and JavaScript and utilizes a database abstraction
layer which means that it supports many database systems, among them the popular
MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sqlite, MsSQL, and many others.

It is based on a [FreeRADIUS](http://www.freeradius.org) deployment with a database server serving as the backend.
Among other features it implements ACLs, GoogleMaps integration for locating
hotspots/access points visually and many more features.
